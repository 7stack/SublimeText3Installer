Sublime Text Linux Installer
=============================

A *really* simple bash installer for Sublime Text3, to deploy it (install/upgrade) on Linux.
The script will check sublimetext.com downloads, auto-grab the sublime text3 build (x86_64), download the tarball, unpack it, install it and create a .desktop file... all in one step.

It's a little ugly, but... it works. I'm not any bash-scripting master on Linux.
So, any comment, improvement or help is always welcome.

## USAGE:
You can clone repo to any location 
```
git clone https://github.com/symmetricAlgo1/SublimeText3Installer.git
chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh

```
